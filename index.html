                <p>A temple has a special place in Indian Hindu life. It is an 
                    exclusive place where people go to worship, to pay their thanks to some Overseeing power for His bounties and blessings.

                    There was a time when education was imparted in temples but it was purely religious.
                    
                    It is my routine to visit a temple. On the day of a festival I went to a temple early in the morning. The temple was humming with activities. The priest was worshipping the gods and goddesses with a lighted lamp. He was humming some holy hymns. When the singing of praise of idols was over he gave ‘prasad’ to the devotees who- had gathered there to have the
                     glimpse of gods and goddesses. Thereafter, sermons began. A priest rendered a sweet but gloomy song telling the realities of the mundane world. The head priest spoke on God, life and soul. Devotees listened to the song and discourse with their eyes closed and occasionally clapping their hands.
                    
                    As the time passed people began to pour in with sweets, flowers and fruits. They placed their offerings at the altar, bowed and sat down to count the beads. Many devotees pushed currency notes and coins in the iron chest. Like other devotees I touched each image with my hands which I also applied to my eyes and then took a few rounds of the images. Almost all rang the bells hanging from the ceiling. They sat on the mats to pray.</p>
